# Development

This document covers working on this repository. It is not the usage contract
for other projects; that is printed by `containerctl brief`.

## Build and check

```sh
make            # build bin/containerctl, bin/containerdns, bin/containerbar.app
make check      # gofmt, go vet, go test, docs-check
make e2e        # tests that start real containers
make install    # copy the built files to PREFIX/bin and APPDIR
make uninstall  # remove them
```

`make check` must pass before a change is finished.

## Layout

| Path | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `internal/stack` | Compose parsing, machine state, containers, proxy, certificates, DNS install |
| `internal/contract` | Command and Compose declarations; help, brief, schema and the generated document sections render from here |
| `cmd/containerctl` | Command line |
| `cmd/containerdns` | DNS server |
| `cmd/containerbar` | Menu bar application and window, in Go with an AppKit layer in Objective-C |
| `cmd/docsgen` | Writes the generated sections of the specification documents |
| `cmd/docscheck` | Verifies links, Korean documents and feature rows |
| `design/` | Design canvas sources; not part of the build |
| `tools/` | Development tools; not part of the build |

## Documentation rules

1. Documents describe current behavior. When direction changes, edit
   `docs/spec/` first and mark what is not implemented.
2. A change that alters behavior updates the specification,
   `docs/features.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` in the same change.
3. English documents are canonical. Each reader-facing document has a
   `<name>.ko.md` twin, edited in the same change.
4. Record test results and deployment results separately. Do not reuse an
   earlier result as evidence for changed code.
5. Documents, comments and commit messages describe this project only.
6. Use direct language: name the action, state the subject and the object, give
   the cause in one sentence. Name the action with the verb for it: create,
   publish, receive, register, remove, return, fail. Do not use metaphor,
   personification or figures of speech. A document, a comment, a commit message
   and an interface string carry the same information in English and in Korean.
   This applies to code comments and commit messages as well as to documents.

After changing a declaration in `internal/contract`, run:

```sh
make docs-generate
```

## Measuring the window

A change to the window's layout is measured, not judged by eye. Start the
application with `-show`, then:

```sh
make window OUT=/tmp/w.png REGION="262 895 205 390"
```

It captures the window by its identifier, so the window does not have to be in
front, and reports each run of pixels holding type with the distance from one
run's centre to the next. Equal distances are what a reader sees as one rhythm.

## Tests that start containers

`make e2e` starts real containers and takes over the machine's proxy, which is
shared. The tests skip when a proxy belonging to another state directory is
running. Set `CONTAINERCTL_E2E_FORCE=1` to run anyway; this removes the proxy
the machine is using.

## Rules the code holds to

The architecture's rules are numbered in
[the specification](docs/spec/architecture.md). They are the standard: a change
that cannot meet one is wrong, and a rule that is wrong is corrected there
first. This table names where the code carries each one, and says so when the
code does not carry it yet.

| Rule | Where |
| --- | --- |
| One proxy per engine | `stack.SyncProxy`, `stack.EnsureProxy` |
| One list from every engine | `stack.List`, `stack.Engines` |
| A name answers with its engine's proxy | `containerdns`'s resolver index, `stack.ProxyHostAddr` |
| The peer link on a host process | Not carried. `stack.SyncProxy` refuses the link when two engines are present |
| Routes come from container labels | `stack.Routes`, `stack.Instances` |
| Domains are machine state | `stack.Machine.Domains` |
| Commands return after the proxy serves the new configuration | `stack.WaitForGeneration` |
| Only `/etc/resolver` writes need administrator rights | `stack.Install.privilegedSteps` |

## Adding a command

1. Declare it in `internal/contract.Commands`, with its effect and whether it
   can require administrator rights.
2. Handle it in `cmd/containerctl/main.go`.
3. Run `make docs-generate`, then `make check`.
4. Add a row to `docs/features.md` and an entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.
