# Troubleshooting

Start with `containerctl doctor`, which reports the machine setup and changes
nothing, and `containerctl status`, which reports what is running.

| Symptom | Cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A name does not resolve | The DNS agent is not registered | `containerctl install` |
| A name does not resolve, and the agent is registered | The answer was cached while the proxy was down | Wait a few seconds and retry |
| 502 from the proxy | The container runs but does not listen on the resolved port | `containerctl logs <service>`, then check the port order in `containerctl schema` |
| 404 from the proxy | No route claims the name: the service is stopped, marked internal, or the domain differs | `containerctl status` |
| Certificate warning on a routed name | The certificate authority is not trusted | `containerctl install` |
| Certificate warning on an unrouted name | A wildcard whose parent is a single label is rejected by clients | Use a two-label domain such as `shop.test` |
| A command asks for the password | The project uses a domain the machine does not delegate yet | Expected; it is asked once per domain |
| The browser still fails after a fix | The browser cached the certificate | Open a new window |
| A name times out, or answers 504 | The route holds the address the container had before it was recreated | `containerctl sync` |

## Which target answered

Every response carries `X-Containerctl-Route`. `address` means the route reached
the container at the address its configuration was built from. `name` means that
address stopped answering and the route fell back to the container's name, which
the runtime resolves.

```sh
curl -sD- -o /dev/null https://web.test/ | grep -i x-containerctl-route
```

A route that keeps answering through the name has an address that is out of
date, which happens when a container is recreated by something other than
containerctl. `containerctl sync` rewrites the configuration from the containers
that are running and reloads the proxy. It starts, stops and changes no
container.

## Reading the state from another program

```sh
containerctl status --json
```

The output carries the machine state, every registered project, each service's
state and address, and the certificate list.

## When the proxy is missing

The proxy is created by any command that produces routes, and removed when the
last route is withdrawn. `containerctl up` in any project recreates it.

## Removing everything

`docs/operations/install.md` lists the removal steps.
