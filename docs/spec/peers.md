# Peers

Status: not implemented. This document states the design; nothing below is in
the binaries yet.

Two machines on one network, each running containerctl, reach each other's
domains. Neither machine's network configuration changes: no router setting, no
DNS server on the network, no hosts file, no privileged port.

That is possible because both machines already answer `.test` themselves.
`/etc/resolver/test` on each sends those names to that machine's own
`containerdns`, so a name that belongs to the other machine is answered by
software this project already owns.

## Identity

A peer is identified by the fingerprint of its certificate authority. The
fingerprint is what a peer is stored under and what the approval is given to.

The machine's name and address are attributes read from the peer. They change
without making it a different peer, they are never compared, and they never
appear in a domain. A name is shown; nothing is decided by it.

## Why a peer is not recognised by its address

The runtime rewrites the source address of a published port. A request from the
network and a request from this machine both reach the proxy as the network
gateway, so the proxy cannot tell them apart. An address is therefore not used
for any decision.

A peer proves who it is by holding a certificate its own authority issued. That
is what a machine checks before serving anything.

## What a machine publishes

Each machine publishes one port on the network, the peer link. Two things answer
on it.

| Path | Client certificate | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/__containerctl/peer` | Not required | `name`, `address`, `domains`, and the authority in PEM |
| Everything else | Required, from an approved peer's authority | The domains this machine serves |

The peer endpoint has to answer before there is any approval, so it cannot ask
for one.

## Approving a peer

One machine is given the other's address and reads `/__containerctl/peer`. It
cannot yet verify what it reads, so it shows the name, the domains and the
authority's fingerprint, and asks.

Approving stores the peer under that fingerprint and writes the peer's authority
into two places the proxy reads: the authorities whose client certificates are
accepted on the peer link, and the authorities a peer's own certificate is
verified against when this machine connects to it.

Nothing is written to the keychain. The peer's authority is a file the proxy
reads, not a trust setting on the machine.

## Certificates

Each machine keeps one authority, which its own system already trusts.

For a domain a peer serves, this machine issues a certificate **from its own
authority**. A browser here is therefore offered a certificate from the
authority this machine already trusts, and no peer's authority is installed
anywhere.

Each machine also holds one client certificate from its own authority. That is
what it presents on a peer's link, and what the peer matches against the
authorities it has approved.

## Name resolution

`containerdns` answers a name in this order:

1. A container on this machine serves it: the answer is this machine's proxy.
2. An approved peer serves it: the answer is this machine's proxy as well.
3. Otherwise: as it answers today.

Both answers name the local proxy. For a peer's domain the proxy holds the
certificate it issued for that name, terminates the request, and forwards it
over the peer's link with this machine's client certificate.

The first rule comes before the second, so a name this machine serves is always
this machine's.

## Duplicate domains

Two machines can end up serving the same domain, because a machine does not ask
a peer before starting a project: a project must start whether or not the other
machine is reachable.

Nothing is refused for it. Each machine serves its own, by the resolution order
above, and the window says the name is served in more than one place. Changing
the domain on one side ends it.

## What this does not do

- No machine name in a domain. There is no `web.<machine>.test`.
- No uniqueness of machine names. Two peers may carry the same name.
- No change to the network. The router, the network's DNS and the other
  machine's system settings are untouched.
- No authority of one machine installed on another.
- No access without a client certificate from an approved authority, including
  from a machine that knows both the address and the name.

## Measured before designing

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Does the source address survive a published port? | No. A request from the network and a request from this machine both arrived as `192.168.64.1`, the network gateway |
| Can the proxy hold a port below 1024 without administrator rights? | Yes. `container run -p 443:80` bound `*.443` and the machine's network address answered 200 |
| Can a machine require a peer's certificate? | Yes. Without one nginx answered 400; with one signed by an approved authority it served and named the peer, `CN=peer-b` |
| Does a browser need the peer's authority? | No. A client trusting only its own machine's authority asked for `web.test` and received the peer's content |
