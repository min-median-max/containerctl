# Using containerctl

Adding a project, serving it over HTTPS, and the daily commands.

## Check the machine first

```sh
containerctl doctor     # prints "nothing to do" when the machine is ready
containerctl status     # the proxy, and every project already registered
containerctl domain     # the domains this machine serves
```

`doctor` changes nothing. When it reports missing steps, run
`containerctl install`; see [Install](install.md).

`status` lists the domains other projects already serve. Choose a different name
for yours: `up` refuses a domain another running project serves and names that
project.

## Add a project

A project is a Compose file. A service with no extra settings is served at
`<service>.<project domain>`, and the project domain is the machine default
unless the file names one.

```yaml
name: myapp

services:
  web:
    image: node:26-slim
    ports: ["3000"]
    command: ["npm", "run", "dev"]
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src
```

```sh
cd ~/work/myapp
containerctl up
```

`https://web.test/` is served.

`ports: ["3000"]` states the port the container listens on. Nothing is published
to a host port: each container has its own address, and the proxy connects to it
directly.

## Choose the name a service is served at

The default is `<service>.<project domain>`. A label sets it explicitly:

```yaml
  web:
    image: node:26-slim
    labels:
      containerctl.domain: shop.test
```

The name must be under one of the project's domains. Two services in a project
cannot claim the same name.

## Services with no domain

A database, a queue or a worker is marked internal. It receives no domain, no
route and no certificate:

```yaml
  db:
    image: postgres:18
    expose: ["5432"]
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: dev
    labels:
      containerctl.internal: "true"
```

The container runs and other services reach it by name.

## Service to service

Reach another service at `<project>-<service>.container.test:<port>`:

```yaml
  web:
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://myapp-db.container.test:5432/app
```

Container addresses are assigned by DHCP and change on every start. Use the
name; the proxy and the services resolve it on each request.

A restarted service takes a few seconds to become reachable by name again.
Connections from other services fail with a timeout until the runtime publishes
the new address.

## Starting and running

A container reports as running as soon as the runtime starts it, which is before
the process inside listens on its port. During that window the proxy returns 502
and a connection from another service fails.

`status` reports such a service as `starting` and states that it is not
accepting connections yet:

```
running  routed   web    192.168.64.89   web.test
starting -        api    192.168.64.74   api.test · not accepting connections yet
```

`up`, `start` and `restart` wait up to 20 seconds for the processes to accept
connections. A service that takes longer is named in the output and the command
returns; the containers are running and the service becomes available on its
own.

## Ports

The container port is read from the first of:

1. the `containerctl.port` label;
2. the first entry of `expose`;
3. the container side of the first entry of `ports`;
4. 80.

The host side of `ports` is ignored.

## Domains

A domain is delegated once for the whole machine. Manage the list from the
command line:

```sh
containerctl domain                    # list them
containerctl domain add lab.test       # delegate another; asks for the password
containerctl domain default lab.test   # what projects use when they name none
containerctl domain remove lab.test
```

Adding a domain writes `/etc/resolver/<domain>`, which tells macOS to resolve
names under it with this tool. That write requires administrator rights, so the
command asks for the password once per domain. `remove` refuses the default
domain and a domain a project pins.

A project uses its own domain by naming it in the Compose file:

```yaml
x-containerctl:
  domain: myteam.test
```

Its services are then served at `<service>.myteam.test`.

A two-label domain such as `myteam.test` also covers names that have no route:
they receive 404. A single-label domain such as `test` does not, because clients
reject a wildcard whose parent is one label, so a mistyped name produces a
certificate warning instead.

The application's **Domains** screen performs the same actions.

## Daily commands

```sh
containerctl up                 # start the project and register its routes
containerctl down               # remove the project and withdraw its routes
containerctl stop db            # stop a service; the container remains
containerctl start db           # start it again
containerctl restart web
containerctl logs -f web        # follow one service's output
containerctl status             # the proxy and every registered project
containerctl status --json      # the same, for another program
```

The application performs the same actions. The project screen carries Start,
Restart and Stop; each service row carries Start, Stop and Logs.

## How a request is served

```
browser
  → /etc/resolver/<domain>     delegates the domain to the local DNS server
  → containerdns               returns the proxy's address
  → containerctl-edge:443      selects the service by Host header
  → <project>-<service>.container.test
  → the container
```

One proxy serves the whole machine and every project shares it. Its
configuration is generated from the labels on running containers, so removing a
project removes its routes without editing a file, and two projects cannot
overwrite each other's configuration.

Plain HTTP on port 80 returns 308 to the HTTPS address.

## When something fails

[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) lists each symptom with its cause and the
command that reports more. The three that cover most cases: a name that does not
resolve means the DNS agent is not registered, 502 means the container is not
listening on the resolved port, and 404 means no route claims the name.

## Handing the project to someone else

Commit the Compose file. Do not commit certificates or keys: each machine issues
its own from its own authority.

```sh
git clone ... && cd myapp
containerctl up
```

The first `up` asks for the password when the project uses a domain the machine
does not delegate yet.
