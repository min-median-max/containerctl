# Changelog

Entries describe behavior changes and the verification run for each. Dates are
the day the change was made.

## 2026-09-07

### Appearance control verified in both directions

Selecting Light in the running window changed the window to light while the
system appearance was Dark, and `defaults read dev.containerctl.bar appearance`
returned `light`. The stored value is applied at the next start.

Verification: `defaults read` after the selection, and a capture of the window.

### A project no longer takes a domain another project serves

Starting a project that claimed a domain a running project already served
removed the running route and printed a warning. `up` and `start` now refuse
before creating any container and name the project holding the domain.

The refusal was found by following `docs/operations/using.md`: a new project
using the default domain took `web.test` from a running project.

Verification: `CONTAINERCTL_E2E=1 go test ./internal/stack -run
TestUpRefusesADomainAnotherProjectServes`, and the operations document was
executed end to end afterwards.

### End-to-end tests assert about their own routes

The tests asserted the machine's total route count, so they failed whenever
another project was running. Each test now counts only the routes under its own
domains.

`docs-check` now rejects a feature row whose evidence names no command, and
verifies that documents name only commands, Compose keys and labels the code
declares. The empty-cell check it replaced passed on any non-empty text.

Verification: `CONTAINERCTL_E2E=1 CONTAINERCTL_E2E_FORCE=1 go test
./internal/stack -count=1` passes with two other projects running, and
`make check` passes.

### Documentation restructured

Documents are split by subject: `docs/spec/` holds contracts, `docs/operations/`
holds procedures, `docs/features.md` holds implementation status and evidence,
and `CHANGELOG.md` holds behavior changes. `README.md` links to them.
`GUIDE.md` was removed; it described a project format the code no longer reads.

Each reader-facing document has a Korean twin with the suffix `.ko.md`.
`make docs-check` verifies links, twins and feature rows, and `make check` runs
it.

Comments across `cmd/` and `internal/` were rewritten to name the action, state
the subject and the object, and give the cause in one sentence.

Verification: `make check` passes, which runs the build, `go test`, `docs-check`
and `go vet`.

### Documentation moved into the commands

`containerctl brief`, `containerctl schema` and `containerctl help <command>`
print the usage contract, the Compose file contract and per-command effects. A
project that installs only the binaries receives these; it does not receive this
repository.

The command and Compose declarations live in `internal/contract`. The
specification documents embed generated sections produced from the same
declarations, and `make docs-check` fails when a document and the code differ.

Verification: `containerctl brief`, `containerctl schema` and `containerctl help
up` produce output; `make docs-generate` wrote the generated sections and a
second run reported no change.

### Window rebuilt as a source list with a dashboard

The window shows a sidebar with Dashboard, Domains, Certificates and one entry
per project, and a detail pane for the selection. The dashboard lists every
project with its service states and every address the proxy serves. An
appearance control in the title bar selects Auto, Dark or Light and stores the
choice in user defaults.

Verification: the application was launched and each screen captured.

### Compose files replace the previous project format

A project is a Compose file. Settings live under `x-containerctl` and in
`containerctl.*` service labels. Keys this tool does not read are ignored.

Verification: `go test ./internal/stack` covers both label spellings, port
resolution from `containerctl.port`, `expose` and `ports`, command and
entrypoint in both forms, and file search in a directory. A project was created
and started from a Compose file containing an internal database service.

### Domains became machine state

A domain is delegated once per machine and recorded in
`~/.containerctl/machine.json`. A project uses the machine default unless its
Compose file pins one. Removing a domain a project pins is refused.

Verification: `go test ./internal/stack` covers add, remove, default change and
the refusal. A project's Compose file was emptied of domain settings and still
resolved through the machine default.

### Internal services

A service labelled `containerctl.internal` runs without a domain, a route or a
certificate. Other services reach it at
`<project>-<service>.container.test:<port>`.

Verification: `go test ./internal/stack` covers the label and the refusal to
combine it with a domain. An end-to-end test confirms the snapshot reports no
route and no URL, and a project with a database service reached it by name.

### Commands wait for the proxy

`nginx -s reload` returns after sending the signal, and a worker being replaced
can accept a connection it does not serve. The proxy now reports the
configuration generation at `/__containerctl/health`, and the commands poll it
before returning.

Verification: the end-to-end test that previously failed on a 15 second client
timeout now completes in under four seconds.

### End-to-end tests no longer disturb a running machine

The proxy is machine-level, so a test using a different state directory removed
the proxy a user was running. The tests now skip when a proxy belonging to
another state directory is running, unless `CONTAINERCTL_E2E_FORCE` is set.
`EnsureProxy` recreates a proxy whose mounted directories differ from the state
directory in use.

Verification: with a proxy running from `~/.containerctl`, the end-to-end tests
report skip with the state directory named.

### DNS returns SERVFAIL while the proxy is down

The DNS server previously returned NXDOMAIN when the proxy was absent, and
macOS cached that answer, so names stayed unresolvable after the proxy
returned. It now returns SERVFAIL, which is not cached.

Verification: with the proxy stopped, a query returned SERVFAIL.

### Certificate authority trusted without administrator rights

Trusting the authority previously used the administrator certificate store,
which requires root and cannot present the confirmation the operation needs.
It now uses the user's trust settings.

Verification: `security add-trusted-cert -r trustRoot` on the authority
returned success without administrator rights, and `security verify-cert`
reported the certificate as valid.
