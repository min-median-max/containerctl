// one launchd job carrying one list of domains and one address, and the proxy
// is one container name per engine.
//
// -state selects the directory holding the authority, the certificates and the
// project registry. It does not divide the machine setup, so one state
// directory owns it and the others read it.

// from the program that answers the domains means the owner cannot disagree
// with what is actually serving them.

// MachineOwner returns the state directory that owns the machine setup and
// whether there is one. No registered agent, or one registered without a state
// directory, means no owner: the next install takes it.
